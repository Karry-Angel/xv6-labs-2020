Q: Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread?
A: Because the function should also be tested with multiple threads.

Q: Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing. 
A: when two thread call insert in the same time, and set e->next to the same entry, but in the end, only one entry can be the head of list.

$ ./ph 2
100000 puts, 2.818 seconds, 35488 puts/ second
